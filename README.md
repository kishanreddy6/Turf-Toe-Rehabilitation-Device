# Turf-Toe-Rehabilitation-Device

This project is part of the course requirements of ROB-GY 6413, Robot for Disability, at NYU which was demonstarated along with my fellow teammates Archit Sharma and Konishjit Bedi.

American football is not only one of the most popular sports in the United States, but also one of the most physically intensive and involves repetitive high-intensity
actions, and immense physical collisions. Although often associated with American football, Turf Toe occurs primarily in athletic environments, such as when an athlete
pushes off to sprint or is tackled with the front of the foot fixed and jammed into the ground, causing the “main toe” to get stuck or caught in a hyperextended position.
Most turf toe injuries do not require surgery and are treated with physical therapy. Although the treatment depends on the severity of the injury, and there is a need for an individualized treatment program specific to the exact nature of the condition and goals, there are some basic exercises that are a part of most lines of treatment. The focus of our project is to deal with this rehabilitation and create a device that can provide help in regaining motion using simple physical therapist-approved exercises for turf toe injuries.

The first few weeks after the injury involve putting less stress on the toe, which doesn’t mean complete rest or R.I.C.E. (Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation), but
means limiting the stress on it. This can be done by Manual Therapy, which involves gently moving and manipulating muscles and joints to improve their motion and
strength. Phase One of the machine would provide gentle stretching exercises to help regain motion.

Phase Two of Toe rehab needs an increase in the stresses that are slowly applied to the tissues, which means working into some degree of big toe extension. In this
phase, the device will enable the patient to apply varying pressure on the toe in a particular direction and count the number of repetitions for the same to facilitate a
routine for rehabilitation exercises. We would do these exercises in a control method, to avoid hyperextension of the big toe, which is often possible when these exercises are done by a patient on their own without any controlling or limiting device or mechanism.
